%	LETTER CONTENT
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am writing to apply for a full-time position at the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) in the Gamma team. I am completing a PhD in statistics and epidemiology at The University of Adelaide and believe my diverse background in professional industry and academia is well suited to providing quality insights and solutions to clients for BCG.

 After graduating my Bachelor of Engineering with first class honours, I began working full time as an engineer in an oil and gas company while completing a Bachelor of Mathematical and Computer Science in my spare time. My role as an engineer required management of risk and continual innovation of assets while communicating to key stakeholders, further developing my communication skills, particularly to management and non-technical audiences. 

Having returned to university to pursue my PhD in an applied science, I am now extremely competent in conveying technical concepts to both non-technical and technical audiences. Along with my experience as a professional engineer in a business environment, I believe I am well suited for consulting in an innovative and transformational environment. My technical skills in object-oriented programming and statistical learning will also provide key insights and develop solutions in multi-disciplinary environments.

I have also contributed to a number of outreach programs and non-profit organisations. Of particular note was providing data analytics to Birthing Kit Foundation Australia to improve their modelling of costs, in my spare time during my PhD.

I look forward to the opportunity of being interviewed in order to share more about my experiences and skills. Thank you for your time and consideration.
