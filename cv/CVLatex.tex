My research focuses on building frameworks to model social behaviours and infectious diseases using digital, non-traditional datasets. I am interested in analysing human behaviours and analysing their effects on models and forecasts of public health measures. I am proficient in Python and standard quantitative packages (numpy, pandas, sklearn etc.), and have some familiarity with R and Matlab.

Key skills involved are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Bayesian inference and machine learning
	\item Building and interrogating statistical models
	\item Event prediction
\end{itemize}

{\footnotesize EMPLOYMENT EXPERIENCE}
\\

\textbf{\large Santos Ltd.}

\emph{Unit Controller Engineer} \hfill \texttt{2015 to 2017}

{\footnotesize
My previous employment required me to work in a remote location in a gas plant control room, where gas production from over 600 wells and multiple facilities is fed to the plant through compressors controlled by myself, to be processed all hours of the day.

\begin{itemize}
\item Communicate issues with other stakeholders clearly and concisely
\item Important commercial and safety decisions are regularly made independently, often employing critical problem solving skills to arrive to a solution
\end{itemize}
}
\emph{Graduate Facilities Engineer} \hfill \texttt{2014 to 2015}

{\footnotesize
As a facilities engineer, I was responsible for various facility assets producing oil and gas, optimising production. Projects were delivered in a timely and economic manner, with deliverables and risks communicated clearly to key stakeholders for approval.

\begin{itemize}
\item Optimisation of gas engines and compressors
\item Project management
\item Risk assessment \\
