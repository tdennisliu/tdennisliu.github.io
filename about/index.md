## About Me

I am a PhD student at the University of Adelaide under the supervision of Joshua Ross and Lewis Mitchell in the School of Mathematical Sciences, and am interested in data science, systems design, meaningful insights and learning algorithms. I returned to postgraduate study after working in industry for 4 years. 

Currently, I am working on developing models of disease outbreaks based on digital data, and understanding the inherent biases in digital data. Alongside this work, I am investigating different statistical & machine learning algorithms to understand their mathematical foundations and their appropriate use.

In my past life, I was a chemical engineer working as a production facilities engineer at [Santos](https://www.santos.com/), where I worked in an asset management role in multiple environments, from the office in company headquarters, to a collaborative video comms room, and finally in a 24 hour operational control room in a gas plant as a fly-in fly-out worker (including night shifts!).
