I am a PhD student at the University of Adelaide under the supervision of Joshua Ross and Lewis Mitchell in the School of Mathematical Sciences. 

I am currently working on interested in developing models of disease outbreaks based on digital data, and understanding the inherent biases in digital data. Alongside this work, I am investigating different statistical & machine learning algorithms to understand their mathematical foundations and their appropriate use.

I am interested in data science, systems design, meaningful insights and learning algorithms.
