I am a currently working as a Data Scientist at [Hatch](https://hatch.team) where we are building a future where everyone can find meaning in work, and to level the playing field in employment. I love reading about data science, systems design, meaningful insights and learning algorithms.

I completed my PhD (pending review) in early 2021 at the University of Adelaide in the School of Mathematical Sciences. In that time I was also part of a COVID-19 modelling task force forecasting COVID-19 cases in Australia for National Cabinet and State Governments across the nation. I worked on developing models of disease outbreaks based on digital data, and understanding the inherent biases in digital data. Alongside this work, I investigated many different statistical & machine learning algorithms, their mathematical foundations, and their appropriate use.

In my past life, I was a chemical engineer working as a production facilities engineer at [Santos](https://www.santos.com/), where I worked in an asset management role in multiple environments, from the office in company headquarters, to a collaborative video comms room, and finally in a 24 hour operational control room in a gas plant as a fly-in fly-out worker (including night shifts!).
