<h1> About Me </h1>

I am a PhD student at the University of Adelaide under the supervision of Joshua Ross and Lewis Mitchell in the School of Mathematical Sciences. Having started in 2017, I am interested in developing models of disease outbreaks based on social media trends and vaccination rates.
I am interested in data science, systems design, meaningful insights and learning algorithms.
